# React/Redux Game of Life

I originally wrote this four years ago or so as I was learning React and Redux. It has been touched up in 3/2021 to reflect more modern JS syntax. Redux was and is still overkill, and was used to practice using the library. It may be yanked in a future revision, and we may also see the class syntax disappear. Currently, I have removed the use of create-react-app, instead using a basic from scratch configuration.

There is still cleanup to be done, and an infinite amount of improvement as I learn and practice more. But it's something.

To play, clone and:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
