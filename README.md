# React Game of Life

This is a React implementation of the zero player game, [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

I originally wrote this in 2017 while I was learning React and Redux. I'm revisiting as of Spring of 2021 as I try to refresh and continue my learning that has been largely dormant in this realm.

Redux was and is still overkill, and was used to practice using the library. It may be yanked in a future revision, and we may also see the class syntax disappear. Currently, I have removed the use of create-react-app, instead using a basic from scratch configuration. I've also modernized some of the JS.

There is still cleanup to be done, and an infinite amount of improvement as I learn and practice more. But it's something.

To play, clone and:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
