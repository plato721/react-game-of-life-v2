# React Game of Life

This is a React implementation of the zero player game, [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

I originally wrote this in 2017 while I was learning React and Redux. I'm revisiting as of Spring of 2021 as I try to refresh and continue the learning that has been largely dormant in this realm.

Redux was overkill, and was used to practice using the library. It has since been removed, although a tag was taken for posterity. I have also removed the use of create-react-app, instead using a basic from scratch configuration bundled with parcel. I've also modernized some of the JS.

To play, clone and:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Enjoy!
